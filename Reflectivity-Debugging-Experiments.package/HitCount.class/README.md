I use a counter and break once i have been reached n times in the cflow.

For now, only one hitcount breakpoint can be set for a given node.

Use the suggestions menu to create instances of myself.

My counter is absolute and you need to reset it after i broke the execution. This option is available through the gutter icon/menu.
